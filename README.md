An open source license recommender system.

This project was a course project for Comp 762, Winter 2012, Recommender systems in software engineering at McGill University. The existing codebase is still what I wrote for the course project requirements and is a bit ugly. 
Now that I am about to finish grad school, I plan to continue this project in my free time. So, soon this project will be online with better usability and functionality, with nicer code and regular updates. Probably, I will also use this as an opportunity to play around with the hack language.
